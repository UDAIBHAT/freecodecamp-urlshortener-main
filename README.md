# freecodecamp-urlshortener
Url Shortener Project for FreeCodeCamp Backend Course.

## About
This project is built using the [freeCodeCamp URL Shortener Boilerplate](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-urlshortener/) as the starting point.

## Implementation Notes
- This project doesn't use a Database, it stores the shortened links in RAM
- **Maybe** later I will add Database support

## Original Boilerplate
The boilerplate code was provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) as part of their Backend Development and APIs certification course.
